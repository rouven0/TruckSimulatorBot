Spread all over the map you will find _Places_.
Every place has it's specified position and an item it produces or gives out. If you have a job that needs an item from somewhere, you have to drive to the place that produces this required item.
Use the menu below to view the information and the position of any place you want to learn more about.

Some actions are bound to these places. You will see them as special buttons when you drive.

By the way, enjoy the place images and look for details. They are gorgeous.
