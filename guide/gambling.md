Feeling lucky? Try Truck Simulator's _happy blinky gambling commands_.
For now, there are two of them.

**Flip a coin**
The `/coinflip` command just flips a coin. It's as simple as it sounds. Nothing special about it.
Oh, you want to know the probabilities? It's 50% that you win and 50% that you don't.

Command syntax: `/coinflip <amount> <side>`
Example command to copy: `/coinflip amount:3 side:heads`

**Watch 'em spinnin'**
A beautifully designed `/slots` command is awaiting your attention. 3 items will spin before your eyes and 3 items will decide over your fate. While 2 identical items will just double your bet, 3 identical items will give you your betted money multiplied by 10. :tada:

Command syntax: `/slots <amount>`
Example command to copy: `/slots amount:3`

By the way, **never** gamble with real money. Almost all gambling mechanisms are designed for you to lose money.
If you wonder who wins on gambling, it's always the casino.
