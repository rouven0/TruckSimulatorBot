Changing a logo is a bit tricky since modals don't come with a emoji selector.
There are 2 ways to set a logo.

**I. Use a unicode emoji**
This is rather easy, just use the emoji selector you OS provides and you're done. Select an emoji and paste it.

**II. Use a discord emoji**
This is where the fun begins. You have to paste the raw emoji to set it as logo. See the image down below for an example and follow these steps:
1. Open the emoji selector, click on the emoji you desire and put a backslash ( \\ ) before it.
In the message bar it should now look like this:
> \\<:DrHorse:879744331009896458>

2. Hit enter. The result in the chat will look like this:
> \<:DrHorse:879744331009896458>

3. Copy it and paste it into the logo field
