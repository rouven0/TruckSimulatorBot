Hey there, looks like you've found the guide <a:PandaEat:892088378978336809>
In the following short articles I will do my best explaining to you how this bot works. Use the menu below to get more detailed explanations about the particular systems.

**Quick summary**
rhe core of this bot is the drive system with its virtual map. Using <:logo_round:955233759278559273>**`/drive`** you can drive to any place you wish to do your jobs or just to enjoy the view.
While you are driving, you can claim _Jobs_ that you will have to execute. Don't worry, an intelligent navigation system will guide you where to go.
Don't forget to keep an eye on your gas. It isn't that cheap when your truck has to be towed away because it can't move by itself anymore.
