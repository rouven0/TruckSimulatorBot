  response: What a crap bot this is! ðŸ˜¡ Hours of time wasted on this useless procuct of a terrible coder and a lousy artist ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ Is this bot even TESTED before the updates are published... Horrible, just HORRIBLE this spawn of incopetence. Who tf made this? A 12 year old child? This child would probably have made it better than THAT ðŸ˜¡
